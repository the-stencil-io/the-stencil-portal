## Responsive design: breakpoints and media queries

The default configuration supports two breakpoints:

| breakpoint        | media query                                  |
|:----------------: |:------------------------------------------:  |
| sm, small: 600px  | `useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down("sm")` |
| md, medium: 900px | `useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down("md")` |


The 'lg' breakpoint will thus be any screen above 900px

Breakpoints are based on Material UI. [https://mui.com/customization/breakpoints/](https://mui.com/customization/breakpoints/)
